    "This project focuses on predicting the prices of luxury and standard vehicles listed on AutoScout24, using machine learning models. The objective is to develop an efficient and reliable predictive model capable of estimating car prices with high accuracy, there by providing valuable insights for buyers, sellers, and enthusiasts in the automotive industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core concept is to determine a vehicle's value based on its characteristics, using a trained model that analyzes various brands and model competitors. This predicted price will then be compared with the actual price listed on AutoScout24. If the ratio is positive, it indicates that the model's predicted price is higher than the actual price on AutoScout24. In such cases, we can infer that the car is priced low given its characteristics.\"\n",

    "3. **Model Saving**: After training, the models are saved for future use. This is done using the `joblib` library, which efficiently serializes Python objects. Each model is saved in the format 'ModelName.joblib', where 'ModelName' represents the specific algorithm or version of the model.\n",

    "2. **Model Evaluation**: Once the models are loaded, `evaluation.py` systematically tests each one. It does this by applying the models to a designated test dataset and computing key performance metrics.\n",

    "3. **Performance Metrics**: For every model, the script calculates two critical metrics: \n",
    "   - **R-squared (R²)**: This metric indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.\n",
    "   - **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: RMSE measures the average magnitude of the errors between predicted values and actual values.\n",
